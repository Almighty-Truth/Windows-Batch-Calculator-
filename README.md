# Windows-Batch-Calculator-
This program is a simple Windows batch script that allows users to perform division calculations between two numbers. It prompts the user to enter two numbers and divides them. If the second number is zero, it prompts the user to enter a new number. The program saves the results in a text file named "results.txt" along with the current date and time.
